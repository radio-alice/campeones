<p><em>Playfulness is a carnivalesque attack on the seriousness of computers</em></p>

<p>Among the endless event announcements on nettime-lat, one event (or rather, one series) in particular stands out: <em>Campeones de la WWW</em>. On July 26th 2002, Arcangel Constantini <a href="https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-lat-0207/msg00085.html">announced</a> his cyberwrestling championships, a series of seven one-on-one 'battles' between the 'most battle-hardened <em>net-artistas</em> in the world'. These battles represent completely undirected play, building a politics through total irrationality, making no obvious, logical critique. I argue this represents a development of naco-style dark play (though it took place earlier), because it takes playfulness through to its most unbounded state- <em>autotelic</em> play (i.e. play that serves no purpose other than play itself). In doing so, cyberwrestling subverted and distorted the structures of the web at a time when it was becoming increasingly clean, streamlined, and cordoned off.</p>
<p>Arcangel Constantini, a net.artist from Mexico City, was one of the most prolific nettime-lat contributors. Born in Mexico City in 1970, he purchased his first internet domain (<a href="https://unosunosyunosceros.com">unosunosyunosceros.com</a>) and started playing with net.art in 1998. He rose to new media art fame through his 1999 Atari Noise project, where he created a glitch art &quot;instrument&quot; out of an Atari game console which would produce fantastic patterns of lines and color when a game cartridge was removed with the console runnning. Atari noise got him into several festivals and exhibitions, and in 2000 Constantini became a curator for the Museo Tamayo's new Cyberlounge contemporary art space.</p>
<p>From his position as curator at the Museo Tamayo, he was able to promote other Latin American net and new media artists, undoing some of the institutional exclusion of new media art in Latin America. In the post-<em>naco</em> discussions around institutionalization, Brian Mackern <a href="https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-lat-0303/msg00030.html">noted</a> that the Museo Tamayo's support for Constantini enabled some of the most important net.art community-building and artistic production in Latin America (and the world). Mackern argued that institutionalization should be used to support artistic projects like Arcangel's (instead of bloated <em>rhizome.org</em> administration). One such project, which Mackern refers to as 'performances net', were the cyberwrestling championships.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>&quot;se enfrentaran semanalmente en una batalla de 48hrs de duracion en la que crearán, transformarán y destruirán la información en el espacio en red www.infomera.net, en un mano a mano mediático, sin reglas y en tiempo real.&quot;</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cyberwrestling contests took place weekly from July through September 2002, pitting various net.artists from across the Americas against each other. The actual battles consisted of a forty-eight hour period in which both contestants had open access to the file system of the infomera.net website (no longer maintained). The login for the website was initially <a href="https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-lat-0105/msg00091.html">shared</a> with the entire nettime-lat listserv; only when somebody kept deleting all the contestants' files did Arcangel restrict access. Over the course of the battle, the two '<em>ciberluchadores</em>' would upload new html files (web pages) to the website and continuously corrupt and alter each other's files creating a semi-choreographed dance of code that unfolded in the online arena. The results were only preserved in <a href="http://www.arc-data.net/inmerso/infomera/memoria/">screenshots</a> that Arcangel spliced together after the battle was over. However, much of the promotional materials (calendar, player cards, etc.) remain available on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20021208211809/http://www.museotamayo.org/inmerso/infomera/index.htm">wayback machine</a>.</p>
<p>Because this project refused to offer any sort of political critique in its content, it moved closer to play from critical playfulness. According to Sicart's framework, play is autotelic– it exists only for its own sake– whereas playfulness is the projection of play characteristics into another space that has its own, non-play intent. <em>Error#2</em> and <em>naco</em> represent playful, critical works; they each mobilize expressly political imagery and rhetoric. On the other hand, <em>campeones</em> represents unrestricted ('<em>sin reglas')</em> play. The entirety of the project lies in the open site access and the subsequent play that occurs there. There is no clever takedown or pointed metaphor; without critical content or political subject matter at the aesthetic level, the project's rhetoric is entirely procedural.</p>
<p>In refusing to advocate any sort of cohesive politics, <em>campeones</em> takes the irrational interactions present in <em>error#2</em> and <em>naco</em> and makes it the entire project. The other two utilize irrationality in combination with explicitly political <em>content</em> to advance a specific political critique, constructing a politics through both their procedures and their subject matter. But <em>campeones</em> advocates a total abandonment of logic– in refusing any sort of meaningful content, it creates a totally procedural critique of neoliberal rationality. That is, without any sort of political, meaningful subject matter, the cyberwrestling project possesses a deeper, more <em>procedural</em> form of irrationality.</p>
<p>If <em>campeones</em> possesses any procedural rhetoric, it is that file access should be open, we should play with everything all the time, and that we should never attempt to fit our actions into market rationale. Such a position is in clear opposition to the (then) emerging <em>Web 2.0</em>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> put the user at the center of online design, pushing the internet from organic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_GeoCities">geocities</a> chaos (memorialized <a href="https://www.cameronsworld.net/">here</a>) to clean, intuitive user experience. <em>Campeones</em> advocates the opposite of this– turning the internet into a chaotic, open playground.</p>
<p>This politics of play is deeply interwoven with a politics of Mexican identity. As Arcangel <a href="http://www.petitemort.org/issue03/23_ephemeral-arcangel/index.shtml">describes</a>, the references to wrestling throughout the project were a nod to Mexican <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre"><em>lucha libre</em></a> culture. Rather than a boxer seeking to knock out his opponent, the <em>luchador</em> wrestles in a semi-choreographed dance. Constantini treated his projects at the Museo Tamayo as an exercise in imagining digital utopias, and that is how we should read the cyberwrestling matches. He advances a vision of an internet of free, open play where Mexican identity is celebrated, not excluded. And he accomplishes this not through logical argument but through systemized irrationality.</p>
<p>But this irrationality didn't just appear in the procedural logic of <em>campeones</em>, it also appeared aesthetically in the <a href="http://www.arc-data.net/inmerso/infomera/memoria/sbvsrs/s41/svr41.htm"><em>memoria</em></a> created by Arcangel Constantini to capture the battles in static web pages that lasted for long after the original &quot;match&quot; was over. The glitchy, broken presentation of the screenshots of the infomera site over the course of the battle represents a conscious aesthetic choice. <em>Memoria</em> emphasizes the malleability and potential for breakage on the internet that was suppressed by Web 2.0 ideals. For <em>net.artistas</em>, the bug was not just a software failure– it was a <a href="https://nettime.org/Lists-Archives/nettime-lat-0010/msg00044.html">symbol</a> for the colonized peoples of the world. Moreover, <em>memoria</em> references a technological specificity of Latin American net.art: slow internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>In Latin America, 'low-tech' aesthetics were integral to creating successful net.art. Because internet speeds often lagged far behind those in Europe or North America, <em>net.artistas</em> had to find creative ways to limit the load times of their pages. Just as ASCII art had a particular significance in Latin American net.art, block-by-block, slow-loading images that make up <em>memoria</em> reference this reality of the slower internet infrastructures in early-two-thousands Latin America. The subtle anti-colonial politics of this aesthetic choice underscores the procedural politics of the cyberwrestling matches themselves. Through taking part in totally undirected irrational play, the <em>campeones</em> refuted neoliberal rationality and, by implication the neoliberal globalization that brought new free-trade agreements, but the same old canonical exclusion of Latin American art. Through seemingly autotelic play, the <em>campeones</em> constructed an online politics that was irrational, utopian, and deeply Latin American.</p>
<p>Rather than seeking to <em>teach</em> its audience a lesson about cultural exclusion or commodification of the online, <em>campeones</em> engages the viewer through its mode of interaction. The very procedures of the project challenge market rationality. <em>Campeones</em> is an exercise in un-marketable, un-commodified play. The cyberwrestling battles subvert neoliberalism not just by taking place outside the market, but by making their subsumption into the market impossible. Through irrationality, auto-telicism, <em>campeones</em> creates an outside to the omni-present neoliberal marketplace. It intervenes in the market-oriented distribution of the sensible to make non-market forms sayable, thinkable, possible.</p>
